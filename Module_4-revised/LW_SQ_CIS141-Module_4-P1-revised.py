#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False. Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)
#   A | B | A AND B | NOT B | (A AND B) or (NOT B) |
#   T | F |    F    |   T   |           T          |
#   T | T |    T    |   F   |           T          |
#   F | T |    F    |   F   |           F          |
#   F | F |    T    |   T   |           T          |
